        <p>As her testimonials show (see Home Page) Adele's unique approach to health and well-being is much appreciated by her clients.
           Having danced since the age of seven, Adele left her home in Bath to train as a professional dancer in London, 
           obtaining a degree in Dance Theatre from the London Studio Centre, University of the Arts London.</p>

        <p>Keen to sustain her own physical condition, she recognised that her forte lay in helping others to maintain theirs. 
          She gradually widened her experience and combined her love of different approaches to fitness with empathy for her 
          growing clientele. Having secured her first post in the fitness industry with Nuffield Health, she rapidly expanded 
          her repertoire, gaining qualifications in Fitness (Reps Level 3) as well as teaching 
          qualifications in Spin (indoor cycling), Body Pump (weights to music), boxercise and kettle bells.</p>

        <p>Keen to adopt a more holistic approach and searching for new ways to develop her practice, 
           Adele has developed and augmented her teaching to include Yoga (Yoga Alliance Registered Teacher) 
           and Stott Pilates (Registered Teacher).</p>

        <p>  Over the last six years Adele has combined working in a corporate fitness environment with training personal 
             clients, also honouring various teaching commitments with larger groups.On a personal level Adele aims to acquaint 
            herself with her clients' specific needs and aspirations,
             devising personal, attainable, and sustainable targets. This includes not only health and fitness guidelines 
             but also advice on nutrition and weight management. This approach has been proven to lead to lasting 
             and beneficial changes in both lifestyle and wellbeing. </p>
