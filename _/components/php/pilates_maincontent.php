         <p> Pilates is synonymous with dance, having studied ballet since the age of seven has meant that it has played a big part in my own training. By putting emphasis on alignment and breathing when practiced correctly with guidance, 
         Pilates can build strength and endurance whilst helping coordination and balance.</p>
          <p>Pilates is great for everyone - whether you are recovering from an injury or reversing the effect from sitting at a desk all day. It can even help the more experienced athlete wanting to take their training to the next level. I have found that a 
          focused approach to alignment and breath has helped nurture healthier and stronger bodies.</p>
          <p>Pilates can compliment more intense training schedules as well as being used in one on one sessions and for rehabilitation.</p>
