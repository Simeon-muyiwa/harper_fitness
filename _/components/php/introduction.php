        <p> Pilates is synonymous with dance, having studied ballet since the age of seven has meant that it has played a big part in my own training. By putting emphasis on alignment and breathing when practiced correctly with guidance, Pilates can build strength and endurance whilst helping coordination and balance.

Pilates is great for everyone - whether you are recovering from an injury or reversing the effect from sitting at a desk all day. It can even help the more experienced athlete wanting to take their training to the next level. I have found that a focused approach to alignment and breath has helped nurture healthier and stronger bodies.

Pilates can compliment more intense training schedules as well as being used in one on one sessions and for rehabilitation.

      <h2> Yoga</h2>
        <p> Having practised yoga for six years I feel that everyone can benefit from a regular yoga practice.  Yoga allows you to transform both physically and mentally; linking body and mind.

In India, 2011, I completed a traditional Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga Teacher Training course. This enriching experience enabled me to develop and grow as a teacher.  I strive to continually refine my yoga teaching and as a result my clients receive a constant yet deepening knowledge of yoga.

I have found, through teaching at various corporate gyms and one on one sessions, that yoga helps clients relax from their hectic schedules and busy lives. It also compliments an intense training regime for the more experienced athlete by helping to improve flexibility and performance.
