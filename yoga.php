         <p> Having practised yoga for six years I feel that everyone can benefit from a regular yoga practice.  
          Yoga allows you to transform both physically and mentally; linking body and mind.</p>
          <p>In India, 2011, I completed a traditional Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga Teacher Training course. This enriching experience enabled me to develop and grow as a teacher.  
          I strive to continually refine my yoga teaching and as a result my clients receive a constant yet deepening knowledge of yoga.</p>
          <p>I have found, through teaching at various corporate gyms and one on one sessions, that yoga helps clients relax from their hectic schedules and busy lives. 
          It also compliments an intense training regime for the more experienced athlete by helping to improve flexibility and performance.</p>
